## Overview of the analysis 
 In this project we work with data visualization software called Tableau to present a business proposal for a bike-sharing company in Des Moines. The core issue we need to think about is what we absolutely need to know in order to create our bike-sharing program in Des Moines.
 
### Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.


## Results
* In this visualization, we graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.
There is a line graph displaying the number of bikes checked out by duration for all users, and the graph can be filtered by the hour.
Final results look similar to the following image:
